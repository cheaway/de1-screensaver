### Technical Changes

1. **coffee_screensaver.tcl**:
   - `https_socket()`: Complete rewrite using proper `{*}` list expansion instead of `concat`
   - `https_socket()`: Added SNI support with fallback for older TLS versions
   - `check_settings()`: Simplified settings initialization
   - `fetch_random_image()`: Added detailed logging for API calls and responses
   - `refresh_image()`: Enhanced with step-by-step logging and better error messages
   - `activate()`: Wrapped entire activation in try-catch with detailed logging
   - `build_ui()`: Complete redesign with modern layout, better spacing, and improved styling

2. **plugin.json**:
   - Updated version to 1.4.0

3. **README.md**:
   - Added comprehensive troubleshooting section
   - Documented TLS requirements (1.7+ recommended)
   - Added common issues and solutions
   - Better organization and clarity

4. **settings.tcl**:
   - No changes (API key must be entered via UI or environment variable)

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed critical HTTPS connection issue**: The original `https_socket` handler used `concat` which broke list expansion, preventing proper TLS connections
- **Fixed SNI support**: Proper handling of Server Name Indication for modern TLS servers
- **Fixed initialization**: Better error handling during plugin activation
- **Improved error messages**: All errors now provide actionable information for troubleshooting

### Known Limitations
- Requires internet connection to fetch images
- Requires Tcl packages: http, tls, json
- TLS 1.7+ required for SNI support (Unsplash API requirement)
